# HomeQuest

This application serves as an example for the information you must provide in your Start Up README.md file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for the deliverable when you submit that deliverable in Canvas. This allows the TA to know what should be graded. The specification deliverable section defines what your application will do. The rest of the deliverable sections reference the rubric for the deliverable and tell where the functionality is in your application, or documents that you did not satisfy that part of the rubric.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Looking for a new home can feel overwhelmingâ€”endless scrolling, confusing information, and scattered details about safety and property management. HomeQuest simplifies the search by letting users enter a ZIP code and instantly see houses, condos, apartments, and rentals for sale or lease. Each listing not only displays pricing but also includes area crime rates and direct contact information for the landlord or management company. With real-time updates and a clean, searchable interface, HomeQuest gives people the clarity they need to make confident housing decisions without the hassle of juggling multiple sites.

### Design

Here's a brief sketch of what the Home/Navigation page could look like. Ideas to the side are ideas for future development, assuming the pitch gets investors.

### Key features

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Correct structure for login, search page, and results page.
- **CSS** - Responsive styling that works across screen sizes, with clear typography, spacing, and accessible contrast.
- **React** - Components for search bar, property list, property detail, user authentication, and routing between pages.
- **Service** - Backend points for:\
    - login/register
    - retrieving property listings
    - retrieving area crime data (via external API call)
    - saving favorites
- **DB/Login** - Store users, saved properties, and listing details. Credentials securely hashed. Only authenticated users can save favorites or post listings.
- **WebSocket** - Notify users in real time when new listings become available in their searched ZIP codes.
